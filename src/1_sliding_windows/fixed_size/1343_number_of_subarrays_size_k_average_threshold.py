1343. Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers arr and two integers k and threshold, return the number
of sub-arrays of size k and average greater than or equal to threshold.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 8], k = 3, threshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: Sub-arrays [2,5,5],[5,5,5] and [5,5,8] have averages 4, 5 and 6
respectively. All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4
(the threshold).

Example 2:
Input: arr = [11, 13, 17, 23, 29, 31, 7, 5, 2, 3], k = 3, threshold = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5.
Note that averages are not integers.
